<h1> Wissam Ghantous </h1> <hr>
<p><b>Hey there, welcome to what will soon become my new webpage. 
I'm slowly going to migrate my math website here -- over the next month or so (or maybe earlier depending on my free time).</b></p>
<p> In the meantime, consult my current website <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/wissamghantous>here. </a> </p> 
<p>In the mean time, enjoy this picture of the supersingular isogeny graph  \Gamma_{1873}(2, 3) that I generated using SAGE. It's the smallest supersingular isogeny graph such that both  \Gamma_{1873}(2) and  \Gamma_{1873}(3) have no loops.</p>
