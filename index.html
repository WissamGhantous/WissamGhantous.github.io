<h1>Hey there.</h1>
<p>I'm slowly going to migrate my math website here, over the next month or so (or maybe earlier depending on my free time).</p>
<p> In the meantime, consult my current website </p> <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/wissamghantous>here. </a> 
<p>In the mean time, enjoy this (partial) picture of the supersingular isogeny graph \Gamma_{1873}(2, 3) that I generated using SAGE. It's the smallest supersingular isogeny graph such that both  \Gamma_{1873}(2) and  \Gamma_{1873}(3) have no loops.</p>
